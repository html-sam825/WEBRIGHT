About us
Trusted Payment Solutions Since 2015

We began in 2015 with a bold vision — to remove the friction from everyday payments and give people a faster, safer, and more transparent way to move money. What started as a small idea has grown into a global platform trusted by millions.

Today, we process over $10 billion annually, helping individuals and businesses send, receive, and manage money with ease. Our commitment to cutting-edge security, real-time settlements, and user-first design sets us apart from traditional financial systems.

We believe payments should work for everyone — no delays, no hidden fees, just instant access and control. Whether you're sending money to family or managing your business finances, we’re here to simplify it all.
